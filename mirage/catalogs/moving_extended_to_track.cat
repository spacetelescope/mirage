# x and y can be pixel values, or RA and Dec strings or floats. To differentiate, put 'pixels' in the top line if the inputs are pixel values.
# radius can also be in units of pixels or arcseconds. Put 'radius_pixels' at top of file to specify radii in pixels.
# position angle is given in degrees counterclockwise. A value of 0 will align the semimajor axis with the x axis of the detector.
#An object value containing 'point' will be interpreted as a point source. 
#Anything containing 'sersic' will create a 2D sersic profile.
# Any other value will be interpreted as an extended source.
#x_or_RA_velocity is the proper motion of the target in units of arcsec (or pixels) per year
#Y_or_Dec_velocity is the proper motion of the target in units of arcsec (or pixels) per year
#if the units are pixels per year, include 'velocity pixels' in line 2 above.
