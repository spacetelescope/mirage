# This file defines the magnitude thresholds for using various sized PSF wing images.
# The magnitudes listed below are the maximum (i.e. the dimmest) for which that file
# will be used. So a table that looks like this:
#
#  abmag  stmag vegamag  number_of_pixels
#    15    15     15           301
#    20    20     20           101
#
# Specifies that sources brigher than 15th magnitude will use an image of the PSF wings
# from file1.fits that is 301x301 pixels.
# Sources between 15th and 20th magnitude will use the central 101x101 pixels from
# file1.fits, and anything dimmer than 20th will not have wings added.
