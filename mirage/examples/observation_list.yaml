#example observation list for the APT -> simulator code.
#
#Observation names must match up with those in the xml
#file from APT.
#Observation dates should be in the format: YYYY-MM-DD
#Roll angle is PAV3, which is available from the
#JWST General Target Visibility Tool (GTVT)
#Roll angles and dates are not checked against the 
#GTVT and do not need to agree with the tool's outputs
#
#For multiple observations that you want taken back-to-back,
#use the same date for all
